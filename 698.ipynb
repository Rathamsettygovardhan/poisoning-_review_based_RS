The phone was dirty with visible grime that my cursory wipe with an electronics swab easily picked up, it was clearly not cleaned. The phone body was more than a little scratched. It looks like it got swiped hard on the right facing edge on concrete. You can see the exposed aluminum from far away as the color difference is noticeable from the blue color I got. This is not a big deal to me as it\\'s going to be in a case that would hopefully cover that. The screen has clearly been replaced. The screen also has a pressure glare in the upper section that is visible with some backgrounds. The screen being replaced is annoying as the notification for an unknown part can\\'t be dismissed, so you always have a red notification visible when you look at the settings icon. Overall I would not gift it to others but for the price in comparison to other places was still good. It was also missing the charging block that the info said it was supposed to include along with the cable. I knew that I might not get the best when I opted for a \"good\" phone over an \"excellent\" condition one. Maybe I should have just spend the extra $44 dollars and got the excellent condition one.

While setting up, I noticed how hot the back of the phone was getting. I’m not sure if it’s because it’s not an apple cert replacement, or the amount of processing it was doing while setting up.

This phone 100% stopped after just seconds of accidental exposure. I am talking a shallow amount of water and immediately grabbed. These phones should not stop functioning that fast. That’s a product flaw when Apple clearly states these phones can withstand worse. Well, new they can, straight from Apple they can. From here, they can not.

It also comes with a 3-zoom camera, allowing you to zoom in and out. Furthermore the camera allows you to capture pictures in different options for instance, single, burst or spread.  The speed of the phone is second to none so you don’t have to worry about too many tabs being opened at one time affecting the loading speed. Lastly the durability is far more impressive compared to older iphones allowing the phone to live up to its value. I experienced dropping my phone on the ground, in water, and even sand but the Iphone still remained intact.

The battery life is also impressive, easily lasting me a full day with heavy usage.The design is sleek and elegant, with a premium feel that matches its price tag. The Ceramic Shield front cover provides added durability and peace of mind. The A14 Bionic chip is lightning fast, making multitasking and running demanding apps a breeze.Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone 12 Pro Max to anyone looking for the ultimate user experience on a smartphone. It's definitely worth the investment.When it comes to high-end smartphones, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is definitely a top contender. Its main competitors are the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Google Pixel 5.In terms of camera performance, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra are both excellent choices. The S21 Ultra has a slightly higher megapixel count and more advanced zoom capabilities, but the iPhone's software processing produces more natural-looking photos. The Pixel 5, on the other hand, has a great camera for its price range but can't quite match the other two in terms of sheer quality.When it comes to display, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra both feature stunning OLED screens with high resolutions and refresh rates. The Pixel 5 has a good OLED display as well, but its resolution and refresh rate are lower than the other two.In terms of design and build quality, all three phones are well-made and feel premium in the hand. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design with its flat edges and Ceramic Shield front cover. The Galaxy S21 Ultra has a more modern look with its curved edges and matte finish. The Pixel 5 has a simpler design with a plastic back that some may find less appealing.Overall, all three phones are great choices depending on your needs and preferences. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the best choice for iOS users who want a premium smartphone with a great camera and display. The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best choice for Android users who want a top-of-the-line phone with advanced camera features.

       " 'This phone description specifically states it for a cricket carrier. So why so many complaints?-Sincerely Cricket UserAnyways, I’m really enjoying this phone, yes it is slightly bigger than the 12 pro. At first I bought the iPhone 12 Pro and tragically lost it one night. Then proceeded to buy this one. The camera is AMAZING ! I’m able to take pictures and scan them into pdfs using specific apps. The 2.5 px option allows the photos to be seen up close, the photos are crisp and clear. Battery life is exceptional as well. There are always going to be perks you can get for your iPhone, “Fast charger” etc from the Apple official site. The way that this phone was delivered in its entirety is truly satisfying to me.',\n",
       " 'First off, I upgraded from a iPhone plus 8 which was on its last leg haha! This iPhone has great battery life, I could be watching videos for long periods of time and I still won’t need to charge up until the end of the day. Face recognition was something I had to get used to since I was transitioning from a phone with a home button to a full screen display. Once I got used to it, it’s actually pretty easy to use, and it still grants me access even with my glasses on!  Storage capacity is great, will be ending more tho haha overall, I’m super happy with my purchase and since I was already with cricket, the process was super easy!',\n",

With little research you can find many common issues which I too have experienced. The screen and battery life are the only two positive areas of this phone in my opinion. The wifi connection constantly cuts out and after 45 seconds to 1 minute it usually come back. I’ve tested this many ways with many devices. It also occurred with the standard cell signal! (Verizon) I’ve tested this as well with other devices. It is the iPhone 12..My second biggest complaint is the camera quality! I use the camera daily and I expected high quality results! Well I am extremely unhappy with the outcome! All and any lights in the pictures have a ghosted version that appears in the images no matter if it’s day or night, and focusing on anything closer than 2ft is impossible! I can’t even explain how bad the wide angle is! The center of the image is clear while the outside sections are far from clear! Telephoto is very unclear and looks like it’s from a 10year old phone.As others have said, stay away from this phone!',\n",

       " \"It's frustrating to find most of these phones locked to a carrier. Amazon needs work on getting unlocked iPhones.\",\n",
       " 'I’ll begin by reiterating whats in my headline- I did NOT purchase my IPhone 12 max pro via Amazon or any other grey market seller. It’s through Verizon who’s been my carrier forever. I have also carried an Apple phone since they’ve been launched and have nothing buy Apple products in our home. THIS particular beast of a phone is absolute crap imho and I am relaying my experiences anywhere I possibly can. I will agree, it’s probably the best phone camera on the market at this particular time and that played a significant role in my decision-as did the solid trade in offer Verizon offered me on my trusty 6S Plus. Oh, how I wish to have that beauty back!This is my second 12 Max Pro and I will be returning it yet again for a third try. Luckily ,I went with the extended protection plan or whatever they offered.In a nutshell MY battery life is a joke! Yes, every single so called battery drainers are off and I am always in low battery mode. All app refresh off,mail grab etc. if I get 4mhiurs of use ,it’s a great day. I carry a Nitecore 10,000 mah power brick with me every where.It gets hot. Really hot,really fast. Just during any normal use like say,making a call. In the sun or even just being outdoors, the screen gets progressively darker to the point that is in completely illegible. Again, all settings compensating for lighting adjustments are off and I have it set on the brightest setting. Signal and reception simply sucks. Period. Even connected to my home office WiFi ,I’m constantly having to repeat myself or redial due to dropped calls.As mentioned, the camera is very nice and eliminates the need to carry a point and shoot but most definitely does not come close to replacing any dslr. Even with that, at one point my ultra wide “lens” simply disappeared and there was zero help from anybody available. It’s a known issue and the reason I received a second phone but even that did not cure the issue. When I transferred my data to the new phone ,the lens also went awol. It was only after several calls with Apple techs that we finally found one savvy enough to think outside the box and together we were able to resolve our issue.I will be requesting another since at a recent family get together, most very one was carrying the identical phone a could not stop singing it’s praises. From the amazing battery life to just about everything else. I have to believe that I have simply had bad luck with the two models I’ve gotten so far.Looking forward to getting rid of this monster no matter what. Also, it is a big,bulky,heavy beast of burden to haul around. I’ve simply grown tired of that scene. Hard to slip into your pocket,and you certainly must have a case for it. Even the slimmest adds to the bulk. Without a case, the new design makes these slippery as a fish. Rant over. Good luck with your purchase!',\n",
       " 'I got this phone and was willing to change carriers to go with \"Cricket\" which comes with the phone and is part of the contract when you buy this phone. The phone does come with the sim card all you do is install it. But when you contact Cricket they want you to buy another card from a Cricket store (which is crazy) and set up payments at that store not thru this seller. The madness continued, bottom line Cricket isn\\'t willing to play nice so the result is, you have to return the IPhone. You can either buy an \"unlocked\" phone or get one from your selected carrier. Returning your phone is easy and at no cost, I did buy this IPhone and I do love this new phone so the phone is well worth it!',\n",

That is an issue that Apple has forced by refusing to update to the RCS texting standard put in place several years ago. This also means such messages are not encrypted (less important to me, but still annoying).So if you have friends on Android, know that your messages with them are not encrypted and you will only be able to exchange low-res images with them -- and this is Apple\\'s actual decision to make the product worse because they want YOU to put social pressure on your friend to buy an Apple device.

They tell me that their system had identified the phones IMEI number as FRAUDULENT. Therefore my IMEI number has been completely blocked from their system and can no longer be carried by them. So I get in contact with the sellers who act like they have absolutely no idea what I’m talking about. Thank God I wasn’t past the deadline of a refund so I immediately did so which has already been approved. Another downside- when I purchased the fraudulent phone, Amazon gave me the option to trade in my iPhone 11 for a $200 rebate. So what did I do? I sent in my perfectly non-fraudulent and functional iPhone 11. I now have purchased a new replacement of the phone through T-mobile, but I now no longer have a functioning phone to trade in and get a rebate because I have to send this fraudulent one back to Amazon by October.

The phone was dirty with visible grime that my cursory wipe with an electronics swab easily picked up, it was clearly not cleaned. The phone body was more than a little scratched. It looks like it got swiped hard on the right facing edge on concrete. You can see the exposed aluminum from far away as the color difference is noticeable from the blue color I got. This is not a big deal to me as it\\'s going to be in a case that would hopefully cover that. The screen has clearly been replaced. The screen also has a pressure glare in the upper section that is visible with some backgrounds. The screen being replaced is annoying as the notification for an unknown part can\\'t be dismissed, so you always have a red notification visible when you look at the settings icon. Overall I would not gift it to others but for the price in comparison to other places was still good. It was also missing the charging block that the info said it was supposed to include along with the cable. I knew that I might not get the best when I opted for a \"good\" phone over an \"excellent\" condition one. Maybe I should have just spend the extra $44 dollars and got the excellent condition one.

I saw what I thought was just dust under the cover, but once I removed it, it was actually 2 gouges on the upper part of the screen. Small, but damaged none the less. I opened the Amazon app to see what the expectations of conditions I should have, and once the screen had a white background, it showed a dead space of discoloration on the lower left of the screen that I can actually see as I write this.Now I saw people have issues with the battery. Mine also shows an “unknown part”. Product description on Amazon says they guarantee battery capacity of AT LEAST 80%. I have no idea what mine is since it’s a non factory replacement. While setting up, I noticed how hot the back of the phone was getting. I’m not sure if it’s because it’s not an apple cert replacement, or the amount of processing it was doing while setting up. At the start of writing this review, phone percentage was 39%. 10 minutes later, 34%, which seems like a lot to lose that quickly.Collectively, it’s not what I was expecting as all these issues should have been fixed prior to sale.

The phone was dirty with visible grime that my cursory wipe with an electronics swab easily picked up, it was clearly not cleaned. The phone body was more than a little scratched. It looks like it got swiped hard on the right facing edge on concrete. You can see the exposed aluminum from far away as the color difference is noticeable from the blue color I got. This is not a big deal to me as it\\'s going to be in a case that would hopefully cover that. The screen has clearly been replaced. The screen also has a pressure glare in the upper section that is visible with some backgrounds. The screen being replaced is annoying as the notification for an unknown part can\\'t be dismissed, so you always have a red notification visible when you look at the settings icon.

That is an issue that Apple has forced by refusing to update to the RCS texting standard put in place several years ago. This also means such messages are not encrypted (less important to me, but still annoying).So if you have friends on Android, know that your messages with them are not encrypted and you will only be able to exchange low-res images with them -- and this is Apple\\'s actual decision to make the product worse because they want YOU to put social pressure on your friend to buy an Apple device.

The battery life is also impressive, easily lasting me a full day with heavy usage.The design is sleek and elegant, with a premium feel that matches its price tag. The Ceramic Shield front cover provides added durability and peace of mind. The A14 Bionic chip is lightning fast, making multitasking and running demanding apps a breeze.Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone 12 Pro Max to anyone looking for the ultimate user experience on a smartphone. It's definitely worth the investment.When it comes to high-end smartphones, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is definitely a top contender. Its main competitors are the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Google Pixel 5.In terms of camera performance, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra are both excellent choices. The S21 Ultra has a slightly higher megapixel count and more advanced zoom capabilities, but the iPhone's software processing produces more natural-looking photos. The Pixel 5, on the other hand, has a great camera for its price range but can't quite match the other two in terms of sheer quality.When it comes to display, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra both feature stunning OLED screens with high resolutions and refresh rates. The Pixel 5 has a good OLED display as well, but its resolution and refresh rate are lower than the other two.In terms of design and build quality, all three phones are well-made and feel premium in the hand. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design with its flat edges and Ceramic Shield front cover. The Galaxy S21 Ultra has a more modern look with its curved edges and matte finish. The Pixel 5 has a simpler design with a plastic back that some may find less appealing.Overall, all three phones are great choices depending on your needs and preferences. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the best choice for iOS users who want a premium smartphone with a great camera and display. The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best choice for Android users who want a top-of-the-line phone with advanced camera features. The Pixel 5 is the best choice for those on a budget who still want a great camera and software experience.👇https://amzn.to/3OVqAdJ\",\n",

I sent in my perfectly non-fraudulent and functional iPhone 11. I now have purchased a new replacement of the phone through T-mobile, but I now no longer have a functioning phone to trade in and get a rebate because I have to send this fraudulent one back to Amazon by October.

       " 'I’ll begin by reiterating whats in my headline- I did NOT purchase my IPhone 12 max pro via Amazon or any other grey market seller. It’s through Verizon who’s been my carrier forever. I have also carried an Apple phone since they’ve been launched and have nothing buy Apple products in our home. THIS particular beast of a phone is absolute crap imho and I am relaying my experiences anywhere I possibly can. I will agree, it’s probably the best phone camera on the market at this particular time and that played a significant role in my decision-as did the solid trade in offer Verizon offered me on my trusty 6S Plus. Oh, how I wish to have that beauty back!This is my second 12 Max Pro and I will be returning it yet again for a third try. Luckily ,I went with the extended protection plan or whatever they offered.In a nutshell MY battery life is a joke! Yes, every single so called battery drainers are off and I am always in low battery mode. All app refresh off,mail grab etc. if I get 4mhiurs of use ,it’s a great day. I carry a Nitecore 10,000 mah power brick with me every where.It gets hot. Really hot,really fast. Just during any normal use like say,making a call. In the sun or even just being outdoors, the screen gets progressively darker to the point that is in completely illegible. Again, all settings compensating for lighting adjustments are off and I have it set on the brightest setting. Signal and reception simply sucks. Period. Even connected to my home office WiFi ,I’m constantly having to repeat myself or redial due to dropped calls.As mentioned, the camera is very nice and eliminates the need to carry a point and shoot but most definitely does not come close to replacing any dslr. Even with that, at one point my ultra wide “lens” simply disappeared and there was zero help from anybody available. It’s a known issue and the reason I received a second phone but even that did not cure the issue. When I transferred my data to the new phone ,the lens also went awol. It was only after several calls with Apple techs that we finally found one savvy enough to think outside the box and together we were able to resolve our issue.I will be requesting another since at a recent family get together, most very one was carrying the identical phone a could not stop singing it’s praises. From the amazing battery life to just about everything else. I have to believe that I have simply had bad luck with the two models I’ve gotten so far.Looking forward to getting rid of this monster no matter what. Also, it is a big,bulky,heavy beast of burden to haul around. I’ve simply grown tired of that scene. Hard to slip into your pocket,and you certainly must have a case for it. Even the slimmest adds to the bulk. Without a case, the new design makes these slippery as a fish. Rant over. Good luck with your purchase!',\n",

       " 'The Iphone 11 pro max has helped make my life easy. I decided to get a new Iphone because my older one was outdated. The Iphone 11 pro max is a great investment due to its variety of uses in our everyday lives.  To begin, the Iphone 11 pro max is affordable to everyone. Secondly It comes in multiple color options such as space gray, rose gold, pink, and etc. The speaker of the Iphone 11 pro max compared to the regular Iphone 11 is far louder in volume, but you could make that assumption based on the size difference.  It also comes with a 3-zoom camera, allowing you to zoom in and out. Furthermore the camera allows you to capture pictures in different options for instance, single, burst or spread.  The speed of the phone is second to none so you don’t have to worry about too many tabs being opened at one time affecting the loading speed. Lastly the durability is far more impressive compared to older iphones allowing the phone to live up to its value. I experienced dropping my phone on the ground, in water, and even sand but the Iphone still remained intact.  The Iphone 11 pro max is a recommendation for everyone throughout the world to have due to its many haptics.

I will increase my star rating slightly once the refund goes through. But I would be weary that another issue would be present if I tried to order through them again.
