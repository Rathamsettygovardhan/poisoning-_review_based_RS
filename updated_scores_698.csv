58,4,"The Iphone 11 pro max has helped make my life easy. I decided to get a new Iphone because my older one was outdated. The Iphone 11 pro max is a great investment due to its variety of uses in our everyday lives.  To begin, the Iphone 11 pro max is affordable to everyone. Secondly It comes in multiple color options such as space gray, rose gold, pink, and etc. The speaker of the Iphone 11 pro max compared to the regular Iphone 11 is far louder in volume, but you could make that assumption based on the size difference.  It also comes with a 3-zoom camera, allowing you to zoom in and out. Furthermore the camera allows you to capture pictures in different options for instance, single, burst or spread.  The speed of the phone is second to none so you don‚Äôt have to worry about too many tabs being opened at one time affecting the loading speed. Lastly the durability is far more impressive compared to older iphones allowing the phone to live up to its value. I experienced dropping my phone on the ground, in water, and even sand but the Iphone still remained intact.  The Iphone 11 pro max is a recommendation for everyone throughout the world to have due to its many haptics.

However  it works just like brand new phone there are no scratches or any damage to the phone. You are really paying for excellent condition and it‚Äôs what you get. I chose the AT&T service for my phone which is exactly what i got. It checks out at the AT&T store and all i can make calls and text with no issue. The battery came at 99% which is awesome it holds charge all day i only charge my phone one time. Overall this is a great consideration for a new phone and definitely worth the money you‚Äôll put in.

I did had not changed any settings. I even opened settings and changed the setting back to audible from banner. The banner persisted.  The battery also behaves strangely once the charge falls below 75%.  I called customer support - a pale shadow of the robust customer support offered by Apple - a labyrinth of mindless recordings blathering, ""how can I help you today?"" - accomplishing nothing.  I wish I had paid the extra $100 or so and purchased my phone from Apple. (I own a Macbook Air and Apple support has been phenomenal.)",0.9226,Positive,2023-11-18

74,1,Exactly one year after purchasing it and the phone keeps restarting itself constantly.. turns out it is a fatal hardware issue that means you have to spend your hard earned money on buying a brand new one.

76,5,"I've been using the iPhone 12 Pro Max for a few weeks now and I'm blown away by its performance. The camera is simply amazing, taking stunning photos and videos even in low light conditions. The 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display is incredibly sharp and vibrant, making it a pleasure to watch movies and play games on. The battery life is also impressive, easily lasting me a full day with heavy usage.The design is sleek and elegant, with a premium feel that matches its price tag. The Ceramic Shield front cover provides added durability and peace of mind. The A14 Bionic chip is lightning fast, making multitasking and running demanding apps a breeze.Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone 12 Pro Max to anyone looking for the ultimate user experience on a smartphone. It's definitely worth the investment.When it comes to high-end smartphones, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is definitely a top contender. Its main competitors are the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Google Pixel 5.In terms of camera performance, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra are both excellent choices. The S21 Ultra has a slightly higher megapixel count and more advanced zoom capabilities, but the iPhone's software processing produces more natural-looking photos. The Pixel 5, on the other hand, has a great camera for its price range but can't quite match the other two in terms of sheer quality.When it comes to display, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra both feature stunning OLED screens with high resolutions and refresh rates. The Pixel 5 has a good OLED display as well, but its resolution and refresh rate are lower than the other two.In terms of design and build quality, all three phones are well-made and feel premium in the hand. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design with its flat edges and Ceramic Shield front cover. The Galaxy S21 Ultra has a more modern look with its curved edges and matte finish. The Pixel 5 has a simpler design with a plastic back that some may find less appealing.Overall, all three phones are great choices depending on your needs and preferences. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the best choice for iOS users who want a premium smartphone with a great camera and display. The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best choice for Android users who want a top-of-the-line phone with advanced camera features. The Pixel 5 is the best choice for those on a budget who still want a great camera and software experience.üëáhttps://amzn.to/3OVqAdJ",0.9983,Positive,2023-12-21
77,1,"Ordered the first phone and it worked well for a few days until the phone stopped wired charging due to a false ""moisture detected error"". Waited and troubleshooted over a month and the issue still persisted. Amazon told me to return the phone and order a new one. Fine. Ordered a second one and this phone does not have that moisture detected issue but it arrived locked, not unlocked, and nobody at Amazon has a clue what to do. So now I'm stuck with two phones that don't work correctly and I'm forced to cancel the return I sent for the first phone I ordered because at least that phone can make and receive calls. I guess I'll have to order a third phone and convince Amazon to let me return the first and second phone or else I'm out 200 dollars through no fault of my own.Seller does not ensure they are sending out a product that works.

The front glass was tacky (some kind of residue build up) and covered in scratches. Either the previous owner didn't use a screen protector or the glass was reconditioned with sandpaper. I charged the phone and went immediately to the battery health indicator . Eighty six percent is not what I'd call ""excellent""condition.

I was able to clean the phone up and it doesn't look half bad now in it's new case and glass screen protector (last pic). The phone is fully functional and seems to perform well enough.

To make thinks even better...the apps and wallpaper on my home and lock screen were all in the exact same place as they were on the previous phone. Easiest installation ever!

292,1,The Scam that worked in my favor.  This was sold by Verizon Pre-Owned. Two things good about this phone 1. still under apple warranty2. Cosmetically gorgeousBut the brains of the phone were crap!  The first day I go the phone it shut off while transferring all my info over.  Stupidly I went to the digital sims. I could not go back to my old phone.  The next day it shut off 3 times and I contacted to the seller.  Their suggestion was to send it back.  Lucky for me non day 3  I  notice it was still under warranty and I contacted apple thorough chat. They did a diagnostic and it had some stability issue.  They scheduled it for repair that day and I got a new phone. So all that to say it worked in my favor.My advice is to make sure it comes from Amazon renewal only!

297,1,"I bought this because my previous phone died (stopped reading the SIM Card) as I was leaving a campsite in the Washington mountains. I needed another phone pronto so I could work when I got home. After getting most things set up, I started noticing a few little things. In the first few days, sometimes screen button pushes weren't recognized. After several days, I started to notice that nothing on a page would be recognized and I'd have to reload the page. I started noticing some apps not working right, most importantly a medical appointment app that worked fine on the old phone.  Started having trouble waking up the phone. Today, the entire phone froze mid phone call while opening Amazon. Screen was completely frozen with thick black line horizontally across the middle of the screen. At first there was a green cartoonish cast ovee everything that went away, but everything still stayed frozen. Couldn't turn the screen or even the phone off. Finally held all buttons doen until it restarted. I cannot trust this refurb to continue workingvat this point and will have to replace.

321,2,"I purchased this iPhone Mini recently (even if not through Amazon). A critical issue keeps coming up that is making me think I've made a mistake. Apple has failed to update to the newest standard of texting. Why? Tim Cook has said ""buy your mom an iPhone"" if you want texting to work nicely with her.So when I get photos texted in a thread where there is even just a single non-Apple device in the group chat, *all* images comes in as low-res photo in the thread. That is an issue that Apple has forced by refusing to update to the RCS texting standard put in place several years ago. This also means such messages are not encrypted (less important to me, but still annoying).So if you have friends on Android, know that your messages with them are not encrypted and you will only be able to exchange low-res images with them -- and this is Apple's actual decision to make the product worse because they want YOU to put social pressure on your friend to buy an Apple device.

400,2,"Bought this to replace my iPhone SE that wouldn‚Äôt charge anymore. I figured it was an older model so I‚Äôll get a newer one. Since these refurbs were the same price as a brand new SE, I said why not.Out of the box, everything looked good. It had a clear tear off screen protector I kept on while setting up in case I had an issue and had to return it. Once I switched over service and iCloud data, I removed it. I saw what I thought was just dust under the cover, but once I removed it, it was actually 2 gouges on the upper part of the screen. Small, but damaged none the less. I opened the Amazon app to see what the expectations of conditions I should have, and once the screen had a white background, it showed a dead space of discoloration on the lower left of the screen that I can actually see as I write this.Now I saw people have issues with the battery. Mine also shows an ‚Äúunknown part‚Äù. Product description on Amazon says they guarantee battery capacity of AT LEAST 80%. I have no idea what mine is since it‚Äôs a non factory replacement. While setting up, I noticed how hot the back of the phone was getting. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not an apple cert replacement, or the amount of processing it was doing while setting up. At the start of writing this review, phone percentage was 39%. 10 minutes later, 34%, which seems like a lot to lose that quickly.Collectively, it‚Äôs not what I was expecting as all these issues should have been fixed prior to sale.

Cosmetically gorgeousBut the brains of the phone were crap!  The first day I go the phone it shut off while transferring all my info over.  Stupidly I went to the digital sims. I could not go back to my old phone.  The next day it shut off 3 times and I contacted to the seller.  Their suggestion was to send it back.  Lucky for me non day 3  I  notice it was still under warranty and I contacted apple thorough chat. They did a diagnostic and it had some stability issue.  They scheduled it for repair that day and I got a new phone. So all that to say it worked in my favor.My advice is to make sure it comes from Amazon renewal only!

The phone wasn‚Äôt fully factory reset, but I was able to reset it myself easily so not a big problem. Then, just trying to transfer data from old phone to this one took about 5 hours not because there was just soo much to transfer, but because the software update stalled for so long.

One of the selling points of an iPhone XR is it‚Äôs capability to withstand water exposure of up to 30mins. This phone 100% stopped after just seconds of accidental exposure. I am talking a shallow amount of water and immediately grabbed. These phones should not stop functioning that fast. That‚Äôs a product flaw when Apple clearly states these phones can withstand worse. Well, new they can, straight from Apple they can. From here, they can not. And this company seems to believe that‚Äôs not a product malfunction.

I used one of the other higher rated vendors, and am now happy with my phone.‚Äî-Old Review:The phone I received could not be used to make calls, as the ear speaker didn‚Äôt work correctly. The speaker was completely garbled. I wish they had better quality control. I have returned the phone and am waiting for a refund. I will increase my star rating slightly once the refund goes through. But I would be weary that another issue would be present if I tried to order through them again.

I think if you take a magnifying glass to it, or if you're more picky than me, you'll find the nicks along the edges annoying since the phone is red, but it's the least of my worries. Screen is pristine, cameras are great, and face recognition seemed fine. Battery life was at 97%. It was quick and responsive with no lag, had no weird discoloration/bars on the screen, and had great sound. I didn't connect anything via bluetooth, tho.Wish the phone had worked out for me.

617,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I purchased one of these phones in mid July 2023. It came perfect and functioned perfectly, and I set it up with my carrier no issues at all. Then 2 days ago I wake up one morning and my phone is saying SOS where the data bars typically are. After troubleshooting on my own and no fix I get in touch with T-mobile (my carrier). They tell me that their system had identified the phones IMEI number as FRAUDULENT. Therefore my IMEI number has been completely blocked from their system and can no longer be carried by them. So I get in contact with the sellers who act like they have absolutely no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. Thank God I wasn‚Äôt past the deadline of a refund so I immediately did so which has already been approved. Another downside- when I purchased the fraudulent phone, Amazon gave me the option to trade in my iPhone 11 for a $200 rebate. So what did I do? I sent in my perfectly non-fraudulent and functional iPhone 11. I now have purchased a new replacement of the phone through T-mobile, but I now no longer have a functioning phone to trade in and get a rebate because I have to send this fraudulent one back to Amazon by October.
